    "    - The significant Earthquake Dataset for the period of 1900–2023 is a thorough database of information on cruical earthquakes that have happened all over the world in the previous 123 years. The National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC)[[1]](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/national-earthquake-information-center-neic) of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)[[2]](https://www.usgs.gov/) is responsible for compiling and maintaining this dataset. To give the most precise and current information on earthquake events, it is frequently updated.\n",
    "   - Each entry in the dataset contains information about one of the more than 37,000 earthquakes that took place during this time period, including the earthquake's date, time, location, magnitude, and depth.\n",
    "    - Seismologists, geologists, and other researchers who study earthquakes, as well as emergency management officials and other experts who work in disaster response and preparation, can all benefit from the dataset. The general public can also benefit from using it to learn more about the past of earthquakes and their effects on human societies.\n",

    "    - On February 6, Turkey experienced two significant earthquakes close to the Syrian border. Sadly, both were stronger than a 7, and 59,259 people were confirmed dead, with 50,783 of them in Turkey and 8,476 in Syria. It is the fifth-deadliest earthquake in the 21st century and the deadliest earthquake on record since the 2010 Haiti earthquake [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake)and the fifth-deadliest of the 21st century [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_21st-century_earthquakes#List_of_deadliest_earthquakes), according to reports.

    "    - Since the beginning of time, natural disasters have had a big impact on human lives, frequently leaving a trail of death and destruction in their wake. Despite this, many areas of the world continue to lack the resources needed to implement necessary measures, particularly when it comes to earthquakes. It is for this reason that our project, which focuses on earthquake data analysis, is so intriguing. We intend to analyze the data to determine how changes in social, political, and economic facets of human life have been impacted. This information might aid in efforts made by the international authority to take the necessary steps for the affected communities. Our ultimate objective is to develop a deeper understanding of the social aspects of earthquake data in order to highlight vulnerable communities and communicate potential suggestions of workable solutions for these communities to the rest of the world."

Using an interactive map and graphs, we hope to investigate the effects and effects of earthquake in various parts of the world.

    "  - We looked at the Significant Earthquake Database from 1900 to 2023 in this notebook. To better understand the data, we loaded the dataset into the notebook, explored the information, and made visualizations. We discovered that the majority of earthquakes range in magnitude from 4 to 6, and that the annual number of earthquakes has grown over time. Additionally, we discovered that the Pacific Ring of Fire, a region with high seismic activity, is where the majority of earthquakes take place. Overall, the dataset contains a wealth of data about earthquakes, and with additional analysis, we can draw additional conclusions from the data."

Our aim it to have an author driven magazine style, as we want to take the user through our exploration of the data linearly to finally towards the end present our key findings. So that the storytelling is controlled, and we control the messaging. However, as we aim to have interactivity through maps. We ultimately, is gonna have a hybrid approach.
